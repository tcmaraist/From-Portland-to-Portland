**Intro**

The theme of this project is a bicycle road trip across the northern United States. The articles detail interesting facts and attractions that can be seen along the way. The goal of this project is create a responsive website from a template, a similar project one is likely to encounter as a professional web-developer.

**Figma**

* This project was built using Figma as a launching point for the design. This is a link to the original template. (https://www.figma.com/file/AtbNbstbxWPcMqvF061V0R/Sprint-3%3A-From-Portland-to-Portland-%7C-desktop-%2B-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)

* All text and images have been exported from Figma.

**CSS Grid**

* The "photo-grid" was made using CSS Grid. The number of columns and rows change according the screen size of the device used to view the website.  

**Responsive Design**

* All of the blocks on this page are responsive to screen size. The blocks, images, and text will all scale up or down depending on the device used to view the website.
