                Still, as sparsely populated as it was in the 1600s, this is an
                extraordinary and highly underrated state full of rich history and
                majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state you want to be
                sure not to miss. As your journey is going to be a long one, you
                had best be prepared for an arduous trek.

                Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first European
                settlers on US territory in the era of Vikings, but is also home
                to L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super sturdy
                backpack from for your 3-month expedition.

                springtime New Hampshire. As serene and beautiful as it was in the

                You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make sense
                to pick up some extra footwear? Fortunately for you, the best
                outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly hails
                from this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham,
                and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots to keep your feet
                dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be confronted by
                while passing through the Appalachians. These boots are also
                better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.

                This is where modern power generators were born as well as contemporary means of transmitting energy. So we figured this would be the perfect place to find a batteryless dynamo light for your bicycle to help you see through those dark lonely roads on your adventure. Such a light from GE will set you back about $10-20.

                Erie, Pennsylvania, not to be confused with the word "eerie," although it can be from time to time, is another town worth passing through for several different reasons. While it might be most famously known as the scene of the Gettysburg address delivered by Mr. Lincoln during the Civil War, Pennsylvania also has produced a rather decent-sized Amish community (eerie, huh?)

                The reason we're brought you here today, if you haven't already guessed, can be summed ip by using one delicious word: chocolate. Hershey's is a Pennsylvania-based company. Most likely, one of the tastiest missions you'll ever embark on during this tour, tru to find an Amish friend and enjoy a bar is the National Wildlife Refuge on your way to Erie and have an extra eerie time!

                From the college capital of Columbus to the clean coastline of Cleveland, Ohio is truly hidden gem. Earthquakes are suprisingly commin is this particular region of North America, over 200 of which have registered with a magnitude of 2 or higher since 1776. However, earthquakes aren't the only thing shaking this centrally located state. One of the country's largest and oldest roller coaster parks is waiting to ROCK your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be one of the most thrilling quests you'll ever complete (provided you can stomach it). Tale a much-deserved break to ride as many roller coasters as you can before continuing your bike ride!
